# node-weather-app
Simple weather app built with nodejs.

My goal was to design a 'simple' weather application, on that did not require hundreds of network transfers like some of the others out there. One that does not track your location or browsing. One without adds. 

Please let me know what you think. All suggestions are welcome.

Uses the openweathermap.org API.
